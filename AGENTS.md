# Utilint engineering principles

Read the nearest nested `AGENTS.md` before changing a workspace. A nested guide applies only to its
subtree and overrides broader guidance.

Scoped guidance begins in the [backend](./apps/backend/AGENTS.md),
[frontend](./apps/frontend/AGENTS.md), and [scripts](./scripts/AGENTS.md) guides. Each guide links to
the narrower guides it owns; follow only the branch relevant to the code being changed.

The repository's compatibility policy is documented separately in
[BETA-COMPATIBILITY.md](./BETA-COMPATIBILITY.md).

## What belongs in an AGENTS.md

Use these files for durable engineering principles that require judgment. Do not record feature
history, current project status, temporary rollout advice, or facts that are readily discoverable
from code and configuration.

Implementing a feature does not justify adding a guideline. Never append a description of the
feature, its operations, or its implementation choices after it lands. Preserve behavior in code,
types, and tests; use prose only to guide future decisions that those mechanisms cannot determine.

Before adding or expanding a rule, all three answers must be clear:

1. What future engineering judgment will this rule change?
2. Why can that constraint not be enforced or derived deterministically?
3. Why is this directory the narrowest scope in which the rule is valid?

If any answer is missing, do not add the rule.

- Put a rule in the narrowest directory where it applies.
- Prefer types, tests, lint rules, and generated checks for deterministic constraints. Do not
  duplicate those checks in prose.
- Add guidance only when violating it would create a meaningful design, security, data-integrity,
  or maintenance risk.
- Remove guidance when its underlying constraint disappears or becomes deterministic.

## Before implementation

State the problem, desired outcome, constraints, and success condition before writing code.
Distinguish the root cause from its symptoms.

For a non-trivial change, discuss ownership, boundaries, important invariants, plausible
alternatives, and tradeoffs with the requester. Include doing nothing when it is a meaningful
alternative. Do not build a capability without a concrete current need.

## Design

- Conform new code to the patterns established by the existing code that owns the same
  responsibility. If an established pattern appears suboptimal, explain the concern and tradeoffs
  to the requester before extending it or introducing a competing pattern; decide together whether
  to refactor the shared pattern first.
- Before writing custom logic for a broadly solved problem, evaluate established, maintained
  libraries. Prefer a suitable library when it meets the required behavior, security, runtime, and
  dependency constraints; use bespoke code only when concrete tradeoffs justify owning it.
- Choose the smallest coherent design with the fewest necessary concepts, states, dependencies,
  and special cases. Prefer deletion or consolidation before addition.
- Give each module one cohesive responsibility and one primary reason to change. Split unrelated
  workflows instead of joining them with flags or broadly optional inputs.
- Assign each invariant to the component that owns and can enforce it. Share a contract only when
  its consumers should change together.
- Keep dependencies explicit and directed toward domain-owned contracts. Construct stateful
  dependencies at a composition root; importing a module must not acquire resources or mutate
  global state.
- Maintain one source of truth for schemas, identifiers, vocabulary, and enum-like values. Derive
  secondary representations instead of copying them.
- Keep public contracts narrow. Generalize only after concrete implementations reveal a stable
  shared abstraction.
- Treat contorted control flow, repeated domain logic, growing mode switches, and lengthy
  explanations as evidence that ownership or boundaries need reconsideration.

## Trust and durable state

- Make the acting identity and resource owner explicit at trust, service, and persistence
  boundaries. Never rely on a process-global principal or an implicit single user.
- Treat persistent data and externally visible contracts as owned state. Destructive or
  irreversible changes require a proven scope, verification method, failure behavior, and recovery
  plan.
- Preserve trust boundaries when sharing code. Authentication, authorization, ownership filtering,
  and capability checks remain with the surface that can enforce them.

## Tests

Each test must protect an important invariant, boundary, or failure mode. Test at the lowest layer
that can prove the behavior, using the real boundary when correctness depends on a database,
filesystem, protocol, or framework contract. Assert observable behavior rather than private call
sequences, and remove redundant tests when a stronger test supersedes them.

## Change scope

Every change should have one outcome a reviewer can state in one sentence. Keep unrelated
refactors, upgrades, generated churn, and renames separate; preserve work already present in the
tree. Update the nearest `AGENTS.md` only when the change establishes or removes an enduring
principle that belongs there.
